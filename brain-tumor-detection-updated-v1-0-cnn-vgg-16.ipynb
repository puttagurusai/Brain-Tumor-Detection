    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI scans using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on the [VGG-16 architecture](https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection). The objective is to create a binary classifier that identifies the presence or absence of a brain tumor from the scan images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics:**  \n",
    "Model performance is measured by accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{Number of correctly predicted images}}{\\text{Total number of tested images}} \\times 100\\%\n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The MRI scans used are from the [Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection) dataset. Images are labeled as either:\n",
    "- **YES** (with tumor) - encoded as `1`\n",
    "- **NO** (without tumor) - encoded as `0`\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: The dataset's origin is not fully documented.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Brain Tumor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A brain tumor is the growth of abnormal cells within the brain, categorized as either benign or malignant. Symptoms vary based on the tumor's location and may include headaches, vision problems, seizures, and other neurological symptoms. Learn more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Setup and Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up the environment, install the required Python packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install imutils numpy tqdm matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn keras plotly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure you have a GPU-enabled environment to handle the CNN training effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The MRI scans are split into training, validation, and test sets:\n",
    "```\n",
    "brain_tumor_dataset/\n",
    "├── TRAIN\n",
    "│   ├── YES\n",
    "│   └── NO\n",
    "├── VAL\n",
    "│   ├── YES\n",
    "│   └── NO\n",
    "└── TEST\n",
    "    ├── YES\n",
    "    └── NO\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is preprocessed as follows:\n",
    "1. Images are resized for consistency.\n",
    "2. Images are split into train, validation, and test sets (80% training, 10% validation, and 10% testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The VGG-16 model is used as a base, with additional layers tailored for this binary classification task. The architecture is fine-tuned to maximize accuracy, using data augmentation to improve generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key model components:\n",
    "- **Convolutional Layers** based on VGG-16 pretrained weights.\n",
    "- **Data Augmentation** to increase the diversity of training samples.\n",
    "- **Dense Layers** for final classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The model achieves the following performance:\n",
    "- **Validation Accuracy:** ~88%\n",
    "- **Test Accuracy:** ~80%\n",
    "\n",
    "A confusion matrix and accuracy score provide further insights into the model’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The VGG-16 model proves effective in detecting brain tumors from MRI scans, achieving high accuracy on both validation and test sets. Future work may involve experimenting with different architectures or larger datasets to improve performance further.\n",

    "The main purpose of this project was to build a CNN model that would classify if subject has a tumor or not base on MRI scan.

    "> A brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: cancerous (malignant) tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which have spread from elsewhere, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. Other symptoms may include difficulty walking, speaking or with sensations. As the disease progresses, unconsciousness may occur.\n",

    "This project was a combination of CNN model classification problem (to predict wheter the subject has brain tumor or not) & Computer Vision problem (to automate the process of brain cropping from MRI scans). The final accuracy is much higher than 50% baseline (random guess). However, it could be increased by larger number of train images or through model hyperparameters tuning."
